# Movable-antenna-enabled-RIS-aided-integrated-sensing-and-communication
This document contains the simulation codes for my paper titled 'Movable antenna-enabled RIS-aided integrated sensing and communication' published in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking.

I will initially release the open-source code corresponding to my arXiv version. However, as the remaining code is associated with follow-up work that has not yet been published, it will be progressively made public after the formal publication of the follow-up work. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Jun for his invaluable assistance with my work. As the author of the article "Secure MIMO Communication Relying on Movable Antennas," the MA geometric channel model he developed has been critically integrated into my code implementation. I wish to reiterate my sincere appreciation for his contributions.

Friends using this codebase are kindly requested to cite our paper using the following reference format. We sincerely appreciate your acknowledgment of our work and contributions to the research community:
